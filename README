The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator is similar to the built-in Unix "dc" calculator.

*****************************************************************
FILES:
*Datum.h: Provided by Mark Sheldon and was included in DatumStack.h.

*DatumStack.h: .h file for the DatumStack class which contains member function declarations (constructor and destructor included) and private memeber variables declarations.

*DatumStack.cpp: .cpp file for the DatumStack class that contains member function definations, constructor initialization, and destructor defination.

*testDatumStack.cpp: .cpp file used to test the member functions of the DatumStack.cpp

*parser.cpp : .cpp file that contains the parseCodeBlock() fucntion used to remove the outermost brackets on a codeblock and then return a string.

*RPNCalc.h: .h file for the RPNCalc class which contains member function declarations (constructor and destructor included) and private memeber variables declarations.

*RPNCalc.cpp: .cpp file for the RPNCalc class that contains member function definations, constructor initialization, and destructor defination.

*testRPNCalc.cpp:  .cpp file used to test the member functions of the RPNCalc.cpp

*main.cpp: .cpp file that runs the calculator
**********************************************************************
COMPILATION & RUN:
compile: type make
run: ./CalcYouLater

*****************************************************************
*DATA STRUCTUE and ALGORITHMS:
For this assignment, I used a singly linked list to represent a stack data structure. A stack was the best for this assignment because our calculator works on a last, in first out (LIFO) bases and that's exactly the same as a stack.

Algorithm for isEmpty:
begin procedure isEmpty
	if front is euqal to NULL
		return true
	else
		return false
end procedure

*****************************************************************
*TESTING:
DatumStack.cpp: After the DatumStack class was writen, the .cpp file - testDatumStack, was written to make sure all the member functions of the class worked great. Refer to the .cpp file for test cases.

RPNCalc.cpp: I employed the unit testing methid when writing and tetsing RPNCalc.cpp. I wrote and tested each helper function individually and for this to be done I made all the functions public. After tetsing was done, I made all functions private so the test file won't work. To run the test file, all functions must be made public again.
